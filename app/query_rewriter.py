Your task is to rewrite the Original Query above into two new queries, specifically for information retrieval:
1.  One rewritten query in **English**, focusing only on the most important keywords.
2.  One rewritten query in **French**, focusing only on the most important keywords.

Guidelines for both rewritten queries:
- Identify the core information need from the Original Query.
- Extract and use only the most crucial keywords for effective search.
- Remove all filler words, articles, and unnecessary context.
- Preserve the original meaning and intent of the query.
- The English query MUST be in English.
- The French query MUST be in French.

Output Format STRICTLY REQUIRED:
- Line 1: The English rewritten query.
- Line 2: The text ---SEPARATOR---
- Line 3: The French rewritten query.
- Your entire response MUST consist of ONLY the English query, then ---SEPARATOR---, then the French query.
- Do NOT include any explanations, numbering, prefixes (like "English Rewritten Query:"), or any other text.

Example of the EXACT output format:
Triskell IT portfolio management advantages budget tracking
---SEPARATOR---
Triskell gestion portefeuille IT avantages suivi budgÃ©taire
